service6
========

A wrapper around the service management parts of s6 (s6-rc, s6-rc-db,
s6-rc-bundle, s6-rc-bundle-update). Details: <https://skarnet.org/software/s6/>

Why?
----

s6's tools really look like they're more meant to be scripted than used by
humans. This isn't a bad thing. It has certainly made writing this utility
very easy and I wish more software suites were written with that kind of 
granularity; however, remembering those commands and typing them over and
over again is an absolute chore.
